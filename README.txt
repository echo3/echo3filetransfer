About
=====
The Echo3 File Transfer Library is a collection of Echo3 components to facilitate uploading and downloading of files between the client and server. 

At the present time this library should be considered API-unstable, i.e., breaking changes may be made to subsequent versions of the API.

Building
========
In order to build the test web application, you must have the echo3 source code checked out and built, and you must set up the location of that checkout as an environment variable.  Look at the included ant.properties to understand what you need to do.
